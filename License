# Quick troubleshooting checklist (most common problems)
- **“file not found” for `inheritance.c`**: make sure you `cd inheritance` and `ls`.
- **Compiler warnings turned into errors** (`-Werror`): fix warnings or compile without `-Werror` for debugging.
- **Segfault**: likely due to wrong pointer usage; try the exact code above. Use `valgrind` if available.
- **Unzipping problems**: install `unzip` or use the Codespace file manager to extract the zip.

If you want, I can:
- produce a single `commit` command sequence you can paste to push everything to GitHub,
- or produce a short Makefile (if your environment lacks it),
- or show how to change GENERATIONS at runtime (compile-time flag vs editing code).

Which of those next steps would you like me to include now?
